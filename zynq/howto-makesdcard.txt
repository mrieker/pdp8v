how to make an bootable SD card:

 1) copy bootable raspi SD card
 2) re-init boot partition (keeping it FAT)
 3) copy BOOT.BIN, image.ub, and make an empty config.txt

or starting with bootable zynq SD card:

 1) copy root filesystem from raspi card to zynq card

either way then:

 1) modify /etc/fstab to mount the correct partitions (UUIDs might be different)

  proc            /proc  proc  defaults          0  0
  /dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot  vfat  defaults          0  2
  /dev/mmcblk0p2  /      ext4  defaults,noatime  0  1

 2) put in zynq and reboot
    serial port console comes up as 9600 baud

 3) maybe unlock root account by setting password with passwd command

 4) update /etc/hostname, /etc/hosts and /etc/dhcpcd.conf
