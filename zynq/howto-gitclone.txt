made from pdp8v.tcl
  file->project->write tcl
  default options (only 'copy sources to new project' checked)

assumes vivado 2023.2 is started from the project directory when tcl file is created,
eg, vivado pdp8v.xpr

when cloning:
 1) start vivado from the project directory and 'source pdp8v.tcl' script
    - it creates a subdirectory with copy of all the source files plus lots of puque
    - tcl error is ok: 'ERROR: [Common 17-69] Command failed: Invalid constraints filename specified'
 2) shut down vivado
 3) delete files from the project directory:
      rm -rf NA pdp8v.srcs vivado.* .Xil
 4) move all files from subdirectory to project directory & delete subdirectory:
      mv pdp8v/* .
      rmdir pdp8v
 5) the dumbbell vivado sometimes moves files, eg, from sources_1/new to sources_1/imported/new
      so git might have to be updated with the moved files
 6) restart vivado from project directory:
      vivado pdp8v.xpr
 7) re-generate the pdp8v.tcl script to reflect the moved files and update it in git
 8) it takes extra time to build (generate bitstream) first time

use makebootbin.sh to create BOOT.BIN file and copy to zturn's /boot/ directory
to test, from the zturn:
  cd nfs/pdp8/driver
  ./raspictl -randmem -printinstr -zynqlib
