1.	ABSTRACT
	--------

	THE KE8-E EXTENDED MEMORY EXERCISER IS A TEST OF THE
	KE8-E "B MODE" INSTRUCTIONS WHICH DURING THE DEFER
	CYCLE USE THE WORD FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTION TO OBTAIN
	THE OPERAND.  THE CAPABILITY OF EACH INSTRUCTION TO
	ACCESS EVERY MEMORY FIELD FROM EVERY MEMORY FIELD
	THROUGH NON-AUTO INDEX AND AUTO INDEX, IS TESTED.

	THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE
	SEQUENCE THEY ARE TESTED.

	A.  DOUBLE PRECISION ADD  (DAD)

	B.  DOUBLE PRECISION STORE  (DST)

	C.  MULTIPLY  (MUY)

	D.  DIVIDE  (DVI)

2.	REQUIREMENTS
	------------

2.1	EQUIPMENT
	---------

	PDP-8/E PROCESSOR WITH AT LEAST 4K OF MEMORY,
	KE8-E OPTION, AND A TELETYPE ARE REQUIRED.

2.2	STORAGE
	-------

	LOCATIONS 0000 THROUGH 7300.

2.3	PRELIMINARY PROGRAMS
	--------------------

	ALL PROCESSOR AND MEMORY RELATED TEST PROGRAMS, AND KE8-E
	INSTRUCTION TESTS 1 AND 2 MUST HAVE BEEN RUN SUCCESSFULLY.

3.	LOADING PROCEDURE
	------------------

	THE BINARY LOADER IS USED TO LOAD THE PROGRAM INTO ANY DESIRED
	FIELD.  REFER TO THE BINARY LOADER DOCUMENTATION IF UNFAMILIAR
	WITH ITS USE.

4.	STARTING PROCEDURE

	-----------------------

	SR0=0	HALT ON ERROR
	SR0=1	NO HALT ON ERROR

	SR1=0	NO LOOP
	SR1=1	SCOPE LOOP (REPEAT PATTERN)

	SR2=0	PRINT ON ERROR
	SR2=1	NO PRINT ON ERROR

4.2	STARTING ADDRESS
	----------------

	THIS PROGRAM STARTS AT LOCATION 0200.

4.3	PROGRAM AND/OR OPERATOR ACTION
	------------------------------

	WITH PROGRAM LOADED IN CORE PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:

	A.  INSURE TELETYPE IS ON-LINE.

	B.  LOAD ADDRESS 0200.

	C.  SET ANY DESIRED OPTIONS IN THE SR.

	D.  PRESS CLEAR AND CONTINUE.

	E.  TYPE IN THE VALUE OF THE HIGHEST MEMORY IN THE SYSTEM
	    FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.
	    (EG, 0 FOR 4K, 1 FOR 8K ON UP TO 7 FOR 32K)
	    IF THE INCORRECT NUMBER WAS TYPED, TYPE RUBOUT AND THEN
	    RETYPE THE MEMORY FIELD VALUE.

	NOTE:

	FOR A NORMAL PROGRAM RUN, LOAD THE PROGRAM IN FIELD 0.  SET SR TO
	0200 AND PRESS LOAD ADDRESS.  NOW SET SR TO 0000 AND PRESS CLEAR
	AND CONTINUE, AND RESPOND TO THE TELETYPE WITH THE VALUE OF THE
	HIGHEST FIELD FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.  THE PROGRAM WILL
	NOW ACCESS EVERY FIELD FROM EVERY FIELD.  AT THE COMPLETION
	OF A COMPLETE PROGRAM PASS, "KE8-EME" WILL BE TYPED ON THE
	TELETYPE.
