ERRORS	------6.1	PROGRAM AND/OR OPERATION ACTION	--------------------------------	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO DETECT OPERATION ERRORS	IN THE MULTIPLY-DIVIDE HARDWARE.  UPON DETECTION OF AN ERROR, THE	PROGRAM EITHER HALTS, OR GIVES AN ERROR PRINTOUT DEPENDING ON THE	SETTING OF SR5.	IN ORDER TO AID IN PINPOINTING THE CAUSE OF AN ERROR, ADD-	ITIONAL SR OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE USER.	SR6, HALT AFTER PRINT OPTION.  HALTS THE PROGRAM TO PERMIT USER	TO EXAMINE THE LATEST ERROR AND DETERMINE IF IT IS THE ONE HE WISHES	TO TROUBLESHOOT.	SR7, PRINT FAILURE RATE OPTION.  INFORMS THE USER OF THE	FREQUENCY OF AN ERROR.  A HIGH RATE OF FAILURE ERROR SHOULD BE EASIER	TO TROUBLE SHOOT THAN AN INTERMITTENT ERROR.  IF THE USER WISHES	TO TROUBLESHOOT USING THE PRESENT SET OF SYMPTOMS, HE CAN THEN SET SR8.	SR8, PRINT SIMULATION AND ENTER SCOPE LOOP OPTION, CAUSES PRINTOUT	OF THE CORRECT CONTENTS OF THE LINK, AND OF THE AC AND MQ REGISTERS	FOR EACH COUNT OF THE STEP COUNTER.  FOLLOWING THE SIMULATION PRINTOUT	THE PROGRAM ENTERS A MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE SCOPE LOOP, DEPENDING ON THE	ROUTINE CURRENTLY IN EXECUTION.  ROUTINES 4 THROUGH 7 DO NOT GIVE A	SIMULATION PRINTOUT, BUT MERELY ENTER THEIR RESPECTIVE SCOPE LOOPS.	NO PRINTOUTS WILL OCCUR UNLESS SR5 IS SET TO 0.	IF SR5 IS SET TO HALT ON ERROR, AND THE USER WISHES TO	OBTAIN PRINTOUTS FOR THE CURRENT FAILURE HE MAY OBTAIN THEM BY	SETTING SR5 TO 0.  (TO PRINT POSITION).6.2	ERROR HALTS AND DESCRIPTION	---------------------------	LOC 1310	MULTIPLY ERROR HALT.  THE AC DISPLAYS NUMBER			OF ROUTINE WHERE FAILURE OCCURRED.  (ROUTINE			0 OR 1.)

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION	-------------------9.1	PROGRAM ORGANIZATION	--------------------	THE PDP-8/E EAE (KE8-E) MULTIPLY-DIVIDE TEST IS ORGANIYED AS FOLLOWS:	A.  CONTROL ROUTINE.  THIS ROUTINE CONTROLS PROGRAM SEQUENCES BY	    HONORING OPTIONS SET IN SR0 THROUGH SR4, AND SR9 THROUGH SR11.	B.  SUBROUTINES	C.  TEST ROUTINES, EIGHT ROUTINES.  ONE PROGRAM PASS CONSISTS	    OF 7 PASSES THROUGH THESE ROUTINES.9.2	MAJOR SUBROUTINES	-----------------	THERE ARE THREE MAJOR SUBROUTINES.  EACH OF THESE SUBROUTINES	IS CALLED ON BY ONE OR MORE TEST ROUTINES.  THESE SUBROUTINES	CONTROL TESTING, ERROR DETECTION, ERROR PRINTOUTS, SIMULATION,	AND SCOPE LOOPS.	A.  MULTIPLY TEST SUBROUTINE.  CALLED ON BY TEST ROUTINES 0 AND 1.	    THE CALLING ROUTINE PROVIDES THE ADDRESS OF A TABLE CONTAINING	    MULTIPLICATION OPERANDS AND THE EXPECTED RESULTS, AND THE	    NUMBER OF TESTS IN THE TABLE.	B.  DIVIDE TEST SUBROUTINE.  CALLED ON BY TEST ROUTINES 2 AND 3.  THE	    CALLING ROUTINE PROVIDES THE ADDRESS OF A TABLE CONTAINING	    DIVISION OPERANDS AND THE EXPECTED RESULTS, AND THE NUMBER	    OF TESTS IN THE TABLE.	C.  MULTIPLY-DIVIDE EXERCISER TEST SUBROUTINE.  CALLED ON BY TEST	    ROUTINES 4, 5, 6, AND 7.  THE CALLING ROUTINE MOVES 2	    OPERANDS TO SYMBOLIC LOCATIONS A AND B, PROVIDES THE	    SUBROUTINE WITH THE ADDRESS OF EXERCISE TO USE, AND THE	    ADDRESS OF THE CORRECT RESULT.9.3	TEST ROUTINES	-------------	THE PROGRAM CONTAINS EIGHT TEST ROUTINES NUMBERED FROM 0 THROUGH 7.	TEST ROUTINE 0.  FIXED MULTIPLY TEST.  MUY INSTRUCTION IS TESTED	USING 55 FIXED TESTS.	TEST ROUTINE 1.  RANDOM MULTIPLY TEST.  MUY INSTRUCITON IS TESTED	USING 500 TESTS WHOSE OPERANDS ARE DETERMINED AT RANDOM.  THE	RESULTS OF THESE TESTS ARE DETERMINED THROUGH SIMULATION.	TEST ROUTINE 2.  FIXED DIVIDE TEST.  DVI INSTRUCTION IS TESTED	USING 40 FIXED TESTS.	TEST ROUTINE 3.  RANDOM DIVIDE TEST.  DVI INSTRUCTION IS TESTED	USING 333 TESTS WHOSE OPERANDS ARE DETERMINED AT RANDOM.  THE RESULTS	OF THESE TESTS ARE DETERMINED THROUGH SIMULATION.	TEST ROUTINE 4.  MULTIPLY/DIVIDE EXERCISE TEST.  THE ROUTINE	GENERATES 700 SETS OF TWO NON-ZERO RANDOM NUMBERS.  EACH SET OF	NUMBERS IS USED TO TEST THE ABILITY OF THE HARDWARE TO PERFORM	SUCCESSIVE MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE OPERATIONS.  THIS ROUTINE CHECKS	FOR CORRECT RESULTS USING THE PROBLEM AXB/B=A.	TEST ROUTINE 5.  MULTIPLY/DIVIDE EXERCISE TEST.  USING THE NUMBER	SET GENERATED BY ROUTINE 4, THIS ROUTINE CHECKS FOR CORRECT	RESULTS USING THE PROBLEM AXB/BXB/A=B.	TEST ROUTINE 6.  MULTIPLY/DIVIDE EXERCISE TEST.  USING THE NUMBER	SET GENERATED BY ROUTINE 4, THIS ROUTINE CHECKS FOR CORRECT RESULTS	USING THE PROBLEM AXB/BXB/AXA/A=B.	TEST ROUTINE 7.  MULTIPLY/DIVIDE EXERCISE TEST.  USING THE NUMBER	SET GENERATED BY ROUTINE 4, THIS ROUTINE CHECKS FOR CORRECT	RESULTS USING THE PROBLEM AXB/BXB/AXA/AXA/B=A.	NOTE:	IF THROUGH PROGRAM SEQUENCE MODIFICATION EITHER OF ROUTINES		5 THROUGH 7 IS EXECUTED PRIOR TO EXECUTION OF ROUTINE 4,		THE ROUTINE CURRENTLY BEING EXECUTED WILL GENERATE A NUMBER SET,		AND THE ROUTINE FOLLOWING WILL USE THIS NUMBER SET FOR		THEIR TESTS.		IN NORMAL OPERATION, ROUTINE 4 GENERATES A NUMBER SET		EVERY TIME IT IS EXECUTED, AND THE ROUTINES FOLLOWING		USE THE NUMBER SET GENERATED BY ROUTINE 4.  THE REASON		THIS IS TO PERMIT EASIER ISOLATION OF A FAILURE.		ROUTINE 4 PERFORMS ONE MUY, AND ONE DVI INSTRUCTION.		ROUTINE 5 PERFORMS THE SAME MUY AND DVI INSTRUCTION,		PLUS ANOTHER MUY AND DVI INSTRUCTION.  BY USING THE SAME		DATA, SHOULD A FAILURE OCCUR IN ROUTINE 5, THE FAILURE IS		THE LOCALIYED TO THE SECOND MUY OR SECOND DVI INSTRUCTION.
