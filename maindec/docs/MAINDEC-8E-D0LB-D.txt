1.	ABSTRACT
	--------

	THIS PROGRAM IS A TEST OF ALL THE KE8-E EAE INSTRUCTIONS.
	(EXCEPT MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE).

2.	REQUIREMENTS
	------------

2.1	EQUIPMENT
	--------

	PDP-8/E OR /M PROCESSOR, KE8-E OPTION, AND A TELETYPE ARE REQUIRED.

2.2	STORAGE
	-------

	LOCATION 0000 THROUGH 7600 ARE USED.

2.3	PRELIMINARY PROGRAMS
	--------------------

	ALL PROCESSOR RELATED TEST PROGRAMS MUST HAVE BEEN RUN
	SUCCESSFULLY.

3.	LOADING PROCEDURE
	-----------------

3.1	METHOD
	------

	THE BINARY LOADER IS USED TO LOAD THE PROGRAM INTO ANY DE-
	SIRED FIELD.  REFER TO THE BINARY LOADER DOCUMENTATION IF
	UNFAMILIAR WITH ITS USE.

4.	STARTING PROCEDURE
	------------------

4.1	CONTROL SWITCH SETTING
	----------------------

	CONTROL SWITCH SETTINGS DO NOT APPLY TO STEP COUNTER, GT, MODE,
	AND COMBINED TESTS.  AN ERROR WILL BE INDICATED BY A PROGRAM HALT.

	SR0=1	HALT ON ERROR

	SR1=1	SCOPE MODE (REPEAT PATTERN AND/OR TEST)

	SR2=1	PRINT ERROR INFORMATION

	SR3=1	DO NOT EXIT CURRENT TEST.

	SR10=11 SR10	SR11
		0	0	EXECUTE TEST IN "A" AND "B" MODES
		0	1	EXECUTE TEST IN "A" AND "B" MODES.
		1	0	SELECT "A" MODE.
		1	1	SELECT "B" MODE.

4.2	STARTING ADDRESS
	----------------

	THIS PROGRAM STARTS AT LOCATION 0200.

4.3	PROGRAM AND/OR OPERATOR ACTION
	------------------------------

	WITH THE PROGRAM LOADED IN CORE PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:

	A.  INSURE TELETYPE IS ON-LINE.

	B.  LOAD ADDRESS 0200.

	C.  SET ANY DESIRED OPTIONS IN THE SR.

	D.  PRESS CLEAR AND CONTINUE.

		NOTE:

		FOR A NORMAL PROGRAM RUN, SET SR SWITCHES TO 5000.
		PROGRAM WILL RUN CONTINUOUSLY EXECUTING THE TEST IN "A"
		 AND "B" MODES UNLESS AN ERROR IS DETECTED AT WHICH TIME
		THE ERROR INFORMATION WOULD BE PRINTED OUT AND THEN
		THE PROGRAM WILL HALT.

5.	ERRORS
	------

5.1	PROGRAM AND/OR OPERATOR ACTION.
	-------------------------------

	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO DETECT OPERATION ERRORS
	IN THE KE-8 HARDWARE.  UPON DETECTION OF AN ERROR, THE
	PROGRAM EITHER HALTS, OR GIVES AN ERROR PRINTOUT DE-
	PENDING ON THE SETTING OF SR 0 AND 2.
