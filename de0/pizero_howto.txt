plug USB cable into center-most connector
give it a few seconds to boot

on homepc, do ifconfig
look for device enp0s29u1u7i1 or similar
do ifconfig enp0s29u1u7i1 192.168.5.1
do ssh pi@192.168.5.2

seems the ifconfig on homepc drops ip address without notice
so put the ifconfig in a loop script one a second
