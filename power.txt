front left filaments:    9 boards = 72 tubes = 72 x 2.5w = 180w
front right filaments:  10 boards = 80 tubes = 200w
rear left filaments:    11 boards = 88 tubes = 220w
rear right filaments:   11 boards = 88 tubes = 220w

left  120V * 45mA/board * 41 boards = 220w
right  96V * 35mA/board * 41 boards = 140w
right   5V * 12mA/board * 41 boards = 2.5w

left total:  180+220+220 = 620w
right total: 200+220+140 = 560w
                          1180w
